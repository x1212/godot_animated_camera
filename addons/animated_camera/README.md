# animated camera
A small addon for Godot Game Engine to make controlling third person cameras easier to control/animate.

This addon adds a new type of node that will simplify creating a camera, that looks at a specific position/node from a set distance and angle.

Also there are options to let it move arround that position in a circle or to switch that point/position and angle with a transition.

The speed of these animations/transitions can be controlled as well by defining how long they may take.
